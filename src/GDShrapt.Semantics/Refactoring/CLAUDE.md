# Refactoring — Refactoring Services

Refactoring services for GDScript code transformations.

## Architecture

```
Refactoring/
├── Services/           - 20 refactoring services
├── Context/            - Refactoring context (selection, cursor)
├── Results/            - Result types (single-file only in Base)
├── GDCrossFileReferenceFinder.cs  - Cross-file reference search
└── GDNodePathReferenceFinder.cs   - Scene node path reference search
```

## Plan vs Execute Model

**Base (Free):** Returns plans only, single-file scope
**Pro (Paid):** Adds execution, batch operations

```csharp
// Base
GDAddTypeAnnotationsResult PlanFile(file, options);  // ✓ Available

// Pro only
GDBatchAddTypeAnnotationsResult PlanProject(options);  // Pro
GDProResult Execute(plan);                              // Pro
```

## Key Classes

### GDRenameService

Cross-file rename with conflict detection.

**Features:**
- Symbol resolution via SemanticModel
- Reference collection with confidence
- Conflict detection (shadowing, redefinition)

**Union/shared reference promotion.** A `Confidence == Union` reference (a member access whose
receiver's data-flow type is a union `A|B`) is a *shared* reference across all member declarations.
It is promoted to a **strict** (auto-applied) edit only when **every** type in its
`SharedTypes` set is renamed in the same operation — i.e. all possible resolutions of the receiver
produce the identical edit, so the rewrite is risk-free. This naturally happens only when the rename
covers all members (e.g. the bridge-connected path, where `declaringTypeName` is null and every
hierarchy's declaration is in scope). Otherwise the union reference stays in `PotentialEdits` (shown,
never applied), so renaming `A.foo` never silently rewrites `x.foo()` where `x` could be `B`.

Coverage is computed by `BuildRenamedDeclaringTypes` (declaring types of the `Declaration`/`Override`
refs in this operation) and checked per shared type via `IsTypeCompatible` (direct or inherited).
`RemoveStrictDuplicatesFromPotential` guarantees a promoted position is not also reported as potential.

The behavior is controlled by `GDRenameService.PromoteFullyCoveredUnionReferences` (default `true`),
surfaced on `GDRenameHandler` and via the Base CLI `rename --no-union-strict` option. When disabled,
union/shared references are always kept potential.

**Union references are union-first.** `GDCrossFileReferenceFinder` (Path A and the member-access Path B)
consults the receiver's raw data-flow union (`DetermineFlowBasedConfidence` reads `CurrentType.Types`)
**before** the collapsed single-type short-circuit, so branch-merge/ternary/multi-assign and call-site
parameter unions surface as `Union` references with `SharedTypes`. Path B resolves the member-op from a
`GDCallExpression.CallerExpression` so the call-node index entry doesn't pre-empt the union entry.

**Union-driven bridge for rename promotion.** A `Union` reference's `SharedTypes` is a data-flow proof
that a call site is shared across hierarchies, so `FindBridgeMethodsWithDuckRef` treats `Union` (alongside
duck `Potential`/`NameMatch`) as a bridge connection. `PlanRename(oldName, …, filterFilePath)` checks
`CollectAllReferences(...).IsBridgeConnected` even when the filter file declares the symbol, and defers to
the bridge-merge path when connected — so renaming covers every shared-type declaration and the shared
call is promoted to a strict edit (fully-covered). The call-site param union is treated as a real union
(promotable); a receiver with no provable union (no call sites) stays Potential.

### GDCrossFileReferenceFinder

Finds references across project files.

**Algorithm:**
1. Find symbol definition
2. Scan all project files
3. Classify references by confidence
4. Return categorized results

### GDExtractMethodService

Extracts selected statements into new method.

**Requirements:**
- Contiguous statement selection
- Dependency analysis for parameters
- Return value inference

## Result Types

**Base (single-file):**
- `GDAddTypeAnnotationsResult`
- `GDFileReorderPlan`
- `GDRefactoringResult`
- `GDRenameResult`

**Pro (batch):**
- `GDBatchAddTypeAnnotationsResult` (Pro only)
- `GDBatchReorderMembersResult` (Pro only)

## Union → Common Base Type Resolution

`GDAddTypeAnnotationsService` resolves union types to common base types when all union members share a hierarchy:
- `Sprite2D | AnimatedSprite2D` → `Node2D` (real annotation at `Medium` confidence)
- Uses `GDUnionTypeHelper.FindCommonBaseType()` via `IGDRuntimeProvider` inheritance chain
- Skips `Object`, `Variant`, `RefCounted` as too generic
- Applies to both variable and return type annotations

## Known Limitations

1. **Extract Method** - Requires contiguous statements, no partial extraction
2. **Cross-file Batch** - Only available in Pro
3. **Confidence Potential/NameMatch** - Execution requires Pro license
4. **Rename Conflicts** - Reports but doesn't auto-resolve shadowing
5. **Extract Variable** - Single expression only, no multi-statement

## Two reference-finding paths (consolidation candidate)

There are currently two reference-finding implementations and two rename entry points:

| Consumer | References | Rename |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| CLI / LSP (`GDFindRefsHandler`, `GDRenameHandler`) | `GDSymbolReferenceCollector.CollectReferences` | `GDRenameService.PlanRename(oldName, …)` → same collector |
| Plugin (`FindReferencesCommand`, gutters, `RenameIdentifierCommand`) | `GDFindReferencesService` | `GDRenameService.PlanRenameAtCursor`/`PlanRenameInScope` → `GDFindReferencesService` |

CLI and LSP are guaranteed identical because they share the collector (pinned by
`GDShrapt.LSP.Tests/Handlers/GDCliLspParityTests.cs`). The Plugin path is separate and could
diverge for local scopes (`GDFindReferencesService` only delegates to the unified collector for
cross-file scopes). Unifying the Plugin onto the CLI/LSP path is a future Plugin-parity task.
